We the students of St. Xavier's College, Kolkata, need to do a dissertaion project in semester 6. 
Here in this project, I have considerd Central Limit Theorem as my topic. I have done simulation studies for different 
distributions to get an idea about the asymptotic behaviour of the distribution of the sample mean. Also, some applications 
are shown there, for example, a real-life application, advantages of CLT in different inferential problems and so on.
Thank you! :)
